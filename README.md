Introduction
Our team has decided to create a 2-player action-adventure game to implement the concepts of concurrency that we learnt in class. This game makes the 2 players assume the role of 2 monsters respectively and they have to outwit each other to take the other out. During the game, there would be power-ups to give players an edge over the other and food to help the player during the final confrontation battle. Also, the players will have access to a skill button that they can activate only if they have enough food collected, which gives them a temporary boost to find their opponent fast or else they would have to subject themselves to the penalty of activating the skill.
